* Welcome to my Public Repository! 

  - This repo is organized by language and project
    - "Arduino Files" contains code I practiced on my arduino as well as the pdf visual of what the project looked like 

    - In "C/C++ Files", there are a bunch of smaller folders: 
      - One contains the Battery management balancing algorithm and other small drafts for our accumulator for Formula 1 Electric. 
      - Another contains Leetcode Interview Problem Practice
      - And then there are smaller projects
    
    - Then, there are a couple of projects: 
      - "Road Network" is a google maps / waze replication that uses different graph algorithms and personal preference to come up with the fastest path from source to destination. It is used on a road network graph of North America. This project is in C++. 
      - "Pitfall" is a remake in System Verilog with VGA applications. Pitfall was an old 80's video game (the first temple run), and I decided to remake it in verilog. Still a work in progress, but it implements OCM on an FPGA with 12-bit VGA compatibility. 

    - There is also "Web Development" which contains a bunch of React, HTML/CSS, and Javascript files used as small little projects to learn the language. My personal website code is also in here.
