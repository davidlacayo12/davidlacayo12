Welcome to my Personal Github

This is where I keep a bunch of tutorials and projects that I have been working on. Good luck. It is organized to me, but only to me. 

- C/C++ Files will have all of my projects dedicated to the coding language of C/C++ and maybe even C#, but I will likely make a new folder for that:
  - Tutorial: mycodeacademy tutorial for C and C++ 
  - Matching app: Simulation I am trying to run for using merge sort and other sorting algorithms to sort and match profiles like Tinder or Match.com
  - 
- HTML Files will have all of my projects dedicated to the coding language of HTML:
  - Tutorial: mycodeacademy tutorial for HTML 
  - CSS Tutorial with styling practice
- Python Files will have copies from my desktop repo since I use a different interface than VSCode to run python: 
  - Beat maker: Beginner level music interface for making beats
  - Tutorial: mycodeacademy tutorial for python
  - pong: buggy version of pong that I made from a tutorial using turtle and pygame extensions in python
- JavaScript Files will have all of my projects dedicated to the coding language of JavaScript (and a little bit of typescript)
  - EMPTY FOR NOW 
- React Files will have all of my projects dedicated to building front end in react/react-native:
  - EMPTY FOR NOW (but add my work on pupil website and pupil app) 
- MYSQL Files will have all of my projects dedicated to building backend through MYSQL and other backend languages and interfaces like MongoDB:
  - EMPTY FOR NOW
