Welcome to my Personal Github

This is where I keep a bunch of tutorials and projects that I have been working on. Good luck. It is organized to me, but only to me. 

- C/C++ Files will have all of my projects dedicated to the coding language of C/C++ and maybe even C#, but I will likely make a new folder for that:
  - Tutorial: mycodeacademy tutorial for C and C++ 
  - Matching app: Simulation I am trying to run for using merge sort and other sorting algorithms to sort and match profiles like Tinder or Match.com
  - Morse Code Translator: Project where user inputs a string that gets translated character by character into morse code
  - Contains Review for CS 225 (C++) 

- CS 225 In Class code: Contains POTD problems and in class code used for examples in lecture 
  *NOTE* -> Plagarism is NOT ok. Owner of repo is NOT responsible for any plagarism that may come as a result of this folder. If you are using this code, it is plagarism-- go do it yourself. 

- ECE 220 In class Code
  - This folder contains all of the code written in class for ECE 220, which specifically, has examples involving dynamic memory, pointers, recursion, arrays, linked lists and trees

- HTML Files will have all of my projects dedicated to the coding language of HTML:
  - Tutorial: mycodeacademy tutorial for HTML 
  - CSS Tutorial with styling practice

- Python Files will have copies from my desktop repo since I use a different interface than VSCode to run python: 
  - beginner projects will contain "learn by doing" for python syntax practice, by building a bunch of beginner programs 

- JavaScript Files will have all of my projects dedicated to the coding language of JavaScript (and a little bit of typescript)
  - EMPTY FOR NOW 

- React Files will have all of my projects dedicated to building front end in react/react-native:
  - Added work for a simple little application to get accustomed to React backend (with Javascript)
  - Add Pupil files 

- MYSQL Files will have all of my projects dedicated to building backend through MYSQL and other backend languages and interfaces like MongoDB:
  - EMPTY FOR NOW

- Greedy Algorithms will have a bunch of example problems that are similar to coding interview questions that I have done 
  - Main language will be python for some, but C/C++ will also be another language I use, since it is crucial to have a core language. However, I will be doing python as well to get comfortable with arguably the most popular/user friendly/ versatile language out there
