* Welcome to my take on "Pitfall", a game that came out on the Atari 2600 in 1982 

- This is a game that I started in ECE 385 as a Final Project, and continued to work on after the class ended. This game is implemented in System Verilog, with a USB keyboard interface with SPI protocol (interfaced with PIOs) using C. It is the original "Temple Run", as "Harry", our main character runs through the Jungle, avoiding obstacles like snakes, pits, and logs, while trying to collect as many treasures as possible.
