Given a list of intervals: [start, end], find the length of the maximal set of mutually disjoint intervals
Contraints: 1<= N <=1e5, 1<= A[i][0] <=1e9

ex) 
    - Input: [[1,2], [2,10], [4,6]]
    - Output: 2

    Explanation: Select [1,2] and [4,6]; selecting [2,10] will block [1,2] and [4,6] 

Solution: Use Dynamic Programming
    - Starts Later? NO
    - Ends Early? YES
