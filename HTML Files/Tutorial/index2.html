<!--This is solely to show how to format your website. Define the sections for organization so that the code is readable--
    otherwise, it can be hard to edit/revise aspects of your HTML website, and this can be a HUGE problem for larger projects

    Specific HTML tags allow google to easily go into your file and figure out the layout/sections of your website -> this is a POWER 
    for tags; they can ABSOLUTELY help the performance of your website
