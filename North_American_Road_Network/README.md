- Link to 10k Matrix: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WfgX9HDBK0wrgJcXPwWdNcL0xOTRAkCI/view?usp=sharing

- To compile the program, simply navigate inside the "src" directory, and type "make" into terminal. Before compiling, must download 10k    matrix and put in src directory 
- To run, type ./main to produce the output of main.cpp.
    - When running, you will receive different prompts. You will be asked your location, as well as desired destination (Examples will be given if you would like to use them, as well as a valid range of vertices). You will then be prompted to input a number, 0-2 based on your preferred route-- (BFS)least nodes (Cities) passed through, (Dijkstra) shorted distance, (Pagerank) best possible route given all data. You will then receive the output to the chosen algorithm based on the user's preffered route, and you can "proceed" down this route. 
    - To run tests, comment out "main" code, and move tests from tests.cpp into main function in main.cpp.
